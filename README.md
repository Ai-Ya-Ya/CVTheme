# CVTheme
A ClearVision theme for Discord. Only works with BetterDiscord and stuff. 

If the image background stops working, download that picture and then reupload it to another image hosting site. Or - [link it locally](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24208607/how-do-i-use-a-local-file-as-a-background-image-with-css).

The background image is actually a real city - a streetview of the skyscrapers of [Tianhe District (天河区)](https://www.pexels.com/photo/high-rise-buildings-during-nighttime-1366957/) of Guangzhou, China (广州市), with the photograph presumably taken from a Pearl River (珠江) river cruise. ~~No wonder I thought it was cyberpunk - no shortage of technocratic dystopia there.~~

### Changelog

- **27/4/2021:** BD updated, re-rolling a bunch of classes; I updated this theme accordingly. No new features.
